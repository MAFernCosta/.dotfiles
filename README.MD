# .dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of my personal dotfiles and scripts.

At the moment, it mainly includes:
- Configuration files for **i3wm**
- Custom scripts used with i3wm
- **nvim** configuration files.

Over time, I will add dotfiles for other applications and tools as well.

## Purpose

This repo acts as:
- A backup of my personal configuration
- A reference for setting up my environment on new systems
- A place to experiment and improve my workflow

The setup is tailored to my own needs and may change frequently.

## Usage

Anyone who finds my configs or scripts useful is free to:
- Use them
- Modify them
- Adapt them to their own setup

No guarantees are made that everything will work out of the box on your system. Review the files before using them.
